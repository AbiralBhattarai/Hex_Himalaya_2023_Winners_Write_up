## Crypto Zoo
### Description:
Could you please help me find the transaction ID for a recent transfer of 1,000,000,000 DX from the hacker's wallet that occurred on November 26, 2020? The funds were stolen from Kucoin, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange.

Note: Enter the flag as CTF{<answer>}.
#### Solution
I found trading information about DX in https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dxchain-token/. There is a link called Explorer there that redirects you to https://etherscan.io/token/0x973e52691176d36453868D9d86572788d27041A9.

On this page, it is possible to download a CSV with the trade history for this coin. Looking at the date of November 26, it was possible to find the following line:
"0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160","11333292","1606384469","2020-11-26 09:54:29","0xd32dbed0609ac3169cc4dd6b781f04cee5ba9550","0xa1d8d972560c2f8144af871db508f0b0b10a3fbf","100000000"

So the flag is:

CTF{0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160}
