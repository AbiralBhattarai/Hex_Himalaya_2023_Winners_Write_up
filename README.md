```
from the given image we find aircraft number , using that number we find the company that owns the aircraft on https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ak/10019092 the flag was the names of the owners

## 6.Crypto Zoo
### Description:
Could you please help me find the transaction ID for a recent transfer of 1,000,000,000 DX from the hacker's wallet that occurred on November 26, 2020? The funds were stolen from Kucoin, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange.

Note: Enter the flag as CTF{<answer>}.
#### Solution
I found trading information about DX in https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dxchain-token/. There is a link called Explorer there that redirects you to https://etherscan.io/token/0x973e52691176d36453868D9d86572788d27041A9.

On this page, it is possible to download a CSV with the trade history for this coin. Looking at the date of November 26, it was possible to find the following line:
"0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160","11333292","1606384469","2020-11-26 09:54:29","0xd32dbed0609ac3169cc4dd6b781f04cee5ba9550","0xa1d8d972560c2f8144af871db508f0b0b10a3fbf","100000000"

So the flag is:

CTF{0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160}

```https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/```
Awaiting your findings, HQ

#### Solution
Go to ```view-source:https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/``` there is ```admin.html```. In ```https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/admin.html``` put random username and password it says<br/> 
```
INVALID LOGIN CREDENTIALS
PLEASE LOGIN AS ADMIN
```
lets check js code ```https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/js/script.js```
```
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    let username = document.getElementById('username').value;
    if (document.cookie === '') {
        document.cookie = "admin=false";
        document.cookie = `user=${username}`;
        window.location = "denied.html" // Redirect
    }
    else {
        let admin = getCookie("admin");
        if (admin === "true") {
            window.location = "panel.html"; // Redirect
        }
        else {
            window.location = "denied.html" // Redirect
        }
    }
});
```
in cookie if admin=true and user=admin then we will redirect to ```panel.html``` so lets manipulate the request<br/>

## 19.HEx Mainframe
### Description:
Your team has been tipped by one of the rebels of a weak vulnerability in HEx' mainframe database. Pretending to be HEx', crack the password, and breach into its mainframe where classified information is stored. Be careful though, as HEx’ robots are always on high alert and they keep changing the password.
Link:```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/```
#### Solution
view the page source,there is a python code which is commented
```

        import hashlib

        def hash_pw(pw_str):                         
            pw_bytes = bytearray()
            pw_bytes.extend(pw_str.encode())
            m = hashlib.md5()
            m.update(pw_bytes)
            return m.digest()
```
i guess this code is been used for hashing the password.lets move forward, from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/robots.txt``` we will get two file
```
 /records.html
 /3outof3.html
```
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/records.html``` we will get list of possible passwords,downloading possible passwords file may be helpfull on further
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/script.js``` we get ```//correct hash is b'\x00u@3 (1/3)``` 
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/style.css``` we get ```/* \xde\x19dD\xc1\tO (2/3) */```
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/3outof3.html``` we get ```\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f' (3/3)```
combining above hash ```\x00u@3\xde\x19dD\xc1\tO\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f``` it is correct hash from possible passwords, now from possible passwords, hash it and compare to ```\x00u@3\xde\x19dD\xc1\tO\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f``` we will get password. lets write some script
```
import hashlib
i=0
a=open("file.txt","r")
s=a.read()
s = s.replace("'", "") 
s=s.replace(" ","") 
name_list = s.split(",")  
def hash_pw(pw_str):
    pw_bytes = bytearray()
    pw_bytes.extend(pw_str.encode())
    m = hashlib.md5()
    m.update(pw_bytes)
    return m.digest()


while(i<len(name_list)):
    pwhash=hash_pw(name_list[i])
    if pwhash == b'\x00u@3\xde\x19dD\xc1\tO\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f':
        print("yes found")
        print(name_list[i])
        exit(0)
    i=i+1

```
password is ```34r7h```
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/script.js``` username is ```HEX``` we got username and password login it grab the flag

## 23.Breaking Bad
### Description:
You discover that dangerous chemical weapons are being transported to the enemy base with the intention of using them against you and your allies. Taking matters into your own hands, you manage to seize the supplies, only to find that they are securely locked in a container that requires a passcode to open. Given the nature of these chemicals, it is crucial to handle them safely, and having some knowledge in chemistry will be advantageous. It is important to remember that all substances are made up of elements, each possessing unique chemical and physical properties, and they cannot be transformed into different substances through typical chemical reactions. As a chemistry enthusiast, your task is to decrypt the passcode.

1 AD 53 EG 45 84 39 22 E 7 T 8 53 A 15 L

1 59 53 47 113 84 85 23 E 7 T 15 53 73 L

P.S.- Prime numbers are exceptional indices 😁
#### Solution
I arranged the both row of passcode by replacing the number by the elements symbol and find the common words in both rows i.e:

```
HADIEGRHPOYTIENTOIAPL

HPRIAGNHPOATVENTPITAL

COMMON:HIGHPOTENTIAL
```

```FLAG:CTF{HIGHPOTENTIAL}```

        if (isalpha(message[i + 1]))
        {
            message[i] = message[i + 1] - KEY;
            if (!isalpha(message[i]))
            {
                message[i] -= 16;
            }
        }
    }
    return message;
}

int main()
{
    string name, address, phone;
    int age;

     input details of a person
    cout << "Identify yourself: ";
    getline(cin, name);
    cout << "Enter the distance you travelled: ";
    cin >> age;
    cin.ignore();
    cout << "Enter planet you are coming from: ";
    getline(cin, address);
    string message = "NYKvZ>qn=`hR:=RYe>RZM_KMhp";
    cout << "Enter the secret passage code: ";
    getline(cin, phone);

    // create an instance of the Person class
    Person p1(name, age, address, phone);

    // call the getDetails method to print the details
    p1.getDetails();
    return 0;
}
```
#### Solution
In the given code file we call the garbler function by passing the message variable and we get the flag.
```
    string message = "NYKvZ>qn=`hR:=RYe>RZM_KMhp";
    string somethin = garbler(message);
    cout<<somethin;
```

```
FLAG: CTF{W3|c0me_70_Th3_W@RF@e}
```

## 28.Death Star
### Description
In order to infiltrate the heavily secured Pinnacle Tower, our team has devised a plan to create a diversion by disabling the main server. To achieve this, we need to obtain the correct password by analyzing and executing the code provided in the file named "PINNACLE" This mission bears a resemblance to an intriguing movie plot reminiscent of "Star Wars."
```
# We are recieving some sort of message but I am not sure what it is. 
# It goes something like MLP{DZOXYJMWSKCLBGXYGADZIGE}
# we recieved the information about the key, it has something to do with the starting date of the event.

def jedi(stormtrooper, key):
    """A secret message is sent through the Force using the Jedi cipher."""
    saber = ""
    for char in stormtrooper:
        if char.isalpha():
            # A Jedi's power is determined by the key value
            shift = ord(key[0].upper()) - ord('A')
            # The Force is strong with this one
            char = chr((ord(char.upper()) - ord('A') + shift) % 26 + ord('A'))
        saber += char
        # The key is constantly changing, like the Force
        key = key[1:] + key[0]
    return saber


stormtrooper = input("Enter a transmission to the Jedi : ")
key = (input("Enter the key for the Jedi transmission: "))

saber = jedi(stormtrooper, key)
print("Jedied message: " + saber)

## 29.Macro Shot
### Description
Does the ancient Word document discovered on one of the Hexagon computers contain any valuable information for us?<br/>
![photo](https://github.com/aayushdangol16/HexHimalaya_CTF_Write_Up/blob/main/photo/mq.png)<br/>
#### Solution
We open the given file to see a bunch of random numbers. Upon closer inspection, we find out that these are ascii codes separated by 0s so we remove the 0s and replace them with spaces . Then we convert the ascii code to text to find the flag.
After removing 0’s:<br/>

## 30.Reverse Me
### Description
Hexagon gave java a shot, and he made a simple program to authenticate users. Can you crack through it?
#### Solution
Opening the given java file, we find the check password function and by looking at the indices of characters in the password, we manually arranged the characters at indices 0-24 to find the flag.<br/>

## 31.Banksy
### Description
In the dumpster behind Hexagon headquarters, we stumbled upon a collection of shredded document fragments. Could you help us reconstruct the pieces and unveil the hidden message, like unraveling a Banksy artwork?
#### Solution
We have provided a fragments of a shredded papper.
We combine those fragments horizontally  by a script i.e:
```
import numpy as np
import cv2 as cv

def Combine_Images_Horizontally(images, spacing=0):
    num_images = len(images)
    
    if num_images == 0:
        raise ValueError("List of images is empty.")

    # Find the maximum height and total width of all images
    max_height = max(img.shape[0] for img in images)
    total_width = sum(img.shape[1] for img in images) + (num_images - 1) * spacing

    # Create a new blank image with the combined size
    new_image = np.zeros((max_height, total_width, 3), np.uint8)

    # Place each image in the new combined image
    x_offset = 0
    for img in images:
        new_image[:img.shape[0], x_offset:x_offset + img.shape[1]] = img
        x_offset += img.shape[1] + spacing

    return new_image

def main():
    image_paths = [
        "banksy4040.png",
        "banksy4642.png",
        "banksy8461.png",
        "banksy13400.png",
        "banksy14346.png", #blank
        "banksy17960.png",
        "banksy3542.png",
        "banksy1694.png",
        "banksy7089.png", 
        "banksy1622.png", 
        "banksy11345.png",
        "banksy17882.png", 
        "banksy14452.png", 
        "banksy7681.png",
        "banksy8340.png",
        "banksy2453.png",
        "banksy14797.png",
        "banksy2561.png",
        "banksy18410.png",
        "banksy3554.png",
        "banksy9240.png", #correct
        "banksy3722.png",
        "banksy7892.png",
        "banksy6313.png",
        "banksy16201.png",
        
        # Add the paths for the remaining 22 images here
        # For example: "image3.png", "image4.png", ... , "image24.png"
    ]

    images = [cv.imread(path) for path in image_paths]

    try:
        New_Combined_Image = Combine_Images_Horizontally(images)
        cv.imwrite("Horizontally_Combined_Image.png", New_Combined_Image)
        print("Combined image saved as 'Horizontally_Combined_Image.png'")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

    input("Please Enter to Continue...")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

Then we obtain a unshredded papper and on that papper we note down the letters in which are blod and arranging them in a sequence we get our flag.
