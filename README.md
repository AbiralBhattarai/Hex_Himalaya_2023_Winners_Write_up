# OSINT
## Mysterious IP
### Description:
157.240.241.35
What is the ASN number and isp of the ip address?

Flag format: CTF{ASNnumber_ISP}
#### Solution
Searching ASN and ISP of 157.240.241.35 on https://hackertarget.com/as-ip-lookup/ 

## Pincode
### Description:
During our surveillance of Phein's networks, our recon team successfully acquired intel indicating the enemy's diminished strength. Consequently, they sought aid from Hexagon and shared the coordinates of their hidden stronghold. However, pincode of the location was encoded within an image that only Hexagon could decipher. Our recon team relayed this information to us, and now we are tasked with precisely identifying the location. Once determined, our team will proceed to the site and eliminate the remaining enemy forces. 
#### Solution
Reverse search the given png image on https://yandex.com We get the clear image,in image there is a url, opening the url we find the location on the address section

## Grounded

#### Solution
given secret seems to be base64, decoding it 
```
One of our crucial local transportation vehicle was stolen! Help us find the current owner/owners of the helicopter to get to the theif.
(If there are two owners then combine their names to get the flag
 Eg. for Riya Manoj and Stan Philip the flag is Riya_Stan)
```
from the given image we find aircraft number , using that number we find the company that owns the aircraft on https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_ak/10019092 the flag was the names of the owners

## Crypto Zoo
### Description:
Could you please help me find the transaction ID for a recent transfer of 1,000,000,000 DX from the hacker's wallet that occurred on November 26, 2020? The funds were stolen from Kucoin, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange.

Note: Enter the flag as CTF{<answer>}.
#### Solution
I found trading information about DX in https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dxchain-token/. There is a link called Explorer there that redirects you to https://etherscan.io/token/0x973e52691176d36453868D9d86572788d27041A9.

On this page, it is possible to download a CSV with the trade history for this coin. Looking at the date of November 26, it was possible to find the following line:
"0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160","11333292","1606384469","2020-11-26 09:54:29","0xd32dbed0609ac3169cc4dd6b781f04cee5ba9550","0xa1d8d972560c2f8144af871db508f0b0b10a3fbf","100000000"

So the flag is:

CTF{0xfdef5b6f6dece6b29695b9fd8d0cadaff944876e598fd443125e1f8c2db15160}

## Bomb
### Description:
UnZip, Check, Repeat
#### Solution
In a challange we have been given a zip file. Name of the zip file was ``` Zipped2048``` inside that zip file there is another zip file named ``` Zipped2047```.The number in the file is like there is 2048 zip file, its like we have to unzip all that zip so lets automate
```
from zipfile import ZipFile
import os
os.chdir("boom")
i=0
while(i<2048):
    a=os.listdir()
    i=i+1
    print(a[0])
    with ZipFile(a[0], 'r') as zip:
        zip.printdir()

## Grandma's Cookie
### Description:
HQ,

Reconnaissance has uncovered an outdated HEx Galactics website, which may potentially contain an insecure administration portal. Requesting your assistance in investigating the website for any vulnerabilities. Historically, HEx Galactics has not been known for employing top-tier developers.
```https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/```
Awaiting your findings, HQ

#### Solution
Go to ```view-source:https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/``` there is ```admin.html```. In ```https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/admin.html``` put random username and password it says<br/> 
```
INVALID LOGIN CREDENTIALS
PLEASE LOGIN AS ADMIN
```
lets check js code ```https://hex-galactics.netlify.app/js/script.js```
```
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    let username = document.getElementById('username').value;
    if (document.cookie === '') {
        document.cookie = "admin=false";
        document.cookie = `user=${username}`;
        window.location = "denied.html" // Redirect
    }
    else {
        let admin = getCookie("admin");
        if (admin === "true") {
            window.location = "panel.html"; // Redirect
        }
        else {
            window.location = "denied.html" // Redirect
        }
    }
});
```
in cookie if admin=true and user=admin then we will redirect to ```panel.html``` so lets manipulate the request<br/>
![brup](https://github.com/aayushdangol16/HexHimalaya_CTF_Write_Up/blob/main/photo/burp.png)
yahh we got ```js/solved.js```it contain base64 encoding
```
const first = "Q1RGe2J1Ny03a";
const second = "DMtbTFMay1qdTU3LW";
const third = "ZsMDRUNS00VzR5IX0=";
```
```Q1RGe2J1Ny03aDMtbTFMay1qdTU3LWZsMDRUNS00VzR5IX0=``` decode it we will get flag
## HEx Mainframe
### Description:
Your team has been tipped by one of the rebels of a weak vulnerability in HEx' mainframe database. Pretending to be HEx', crack the password, and breach into its mainframe where classified information is stored. Be careful though, as HExâ€™ robots are always on high alert and they keep changing the password.
Link:```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/```
#### Solution
view the page source,there is a python code which is commented
```

        import hashlib

        def hash_pw(pw_str):                         
            pw_bytes = bytearray()
            pw_bytes.extend(pw_str.encode())
            m = hashlib.md5()
            m.update(pw_bytes)
            return m.digest()
```
i guess this code is been used for hashing the password.lets move forward, from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/robots.txt``` we will get two file
```
 /records.html
 /3outof3.html
```
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/records.html``` we will get list of possible passwords,downloading possible passwords file may be helpfull on further
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/script.js``` we get ```//correct hash is b'\x00u@3 (1/3)``` 
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/style.css``` we get ```/* \xde\x19dD\xc1\tO (2/3) */```
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/3outof3.html``` we get ```\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f' (3/3)```
combining above hash ```\x00u@3\xde\x19dD\xc1\tO\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f``` it is correct hash from possible passwords, now from possible passwords, hash it and compare to ```\x00u@3\xde\x19dD\xc1\tO\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f``` we will get password. lets write some script
```
import hashlib
i=0
a=open("file.txt","r")
s=a.read()
s = s.replace("'", "") 
s=s.replace(" ","") 
name_list = s.split(",")  
def hash_pw(pw_str):
    pw_bytes = bytearray()
    pw_bytes.extend(pw_str.encode())
    m = hashlib.md5()
    m.update(pw_bytes)
    return m.digest()


while(i<len(name_list)):
    pwhash=hash_pw(name_list[i])
    if pwhash == b'\x00u@3\xde\x19dD\xc1\tO\x9d\x9f\xf45\x8f':
        print("yes found")
        print(name_list[i])
        exit(0)
    i=i+1

```
password is ```34r7h```
from ```https://hex-mainframe.netlify.app/script.js``` username is ```HEX``` we got username and password login it grab the flag
